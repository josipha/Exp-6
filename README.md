# Exp - 6 STUDENT ONLINE EXAM REGISTRATION SYSTEM
# AIM:
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Student Online Exam Registration System.

# SRS (Procedure):

The system aims to automate student registration for exams, subject selection, fee payment, and hall-ticket generation.

## Step 2: Requirement Analysis

Users: Admin, Exam Coordinator, Student.

Main Functions:
Student registration, subject selection, exam scheduling, fee payment, hall-ticket generation, and report generation.

Non-Functional Needs:
Security of student data, reliability, and easy access.

## Step 3: System Design

Create UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, and Package diagrams.
Design database tables for Students, Subjects, Exam Registration, Fees, and Hall Tickets.
